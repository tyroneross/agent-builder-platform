# Agent Builder — Codex Plugin Guide

## What this plugin is

A cross-LLM skill for designing and evaluating agentic harnesses — tool use, permissions, workflow state, memory, evals, observability, multi-agent, and framework selection.

## How Codex accesses this plugin

The marketplace install points at `path: plugin` inside this repo. The `plugin/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` maps `"skills": "./"`, which auto-loads `plugin/SKILL.md` on install. No commands, no MCP servers ship with this plugin.

## Skills

| Skill ID | Purpose | Load when |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `agent-builder` | Design, evaluate, or rebuild agentic harnesses | User is designing a new agent/harness, evaluating an existing one, choosing between frameworks or memory substrates, or showing harness-gap symptoms (tool sprawl, brittle state, missing evals, cost drift) |

### Modes (declared in SKILL.md)

| Mode | Use |
|------|-----|
| `design` | Creating a new harness or planning a major rebuild |
| `evaluation` | Auditing an existing harness for gaps, risks, or missing primitives |
| `design + evaluation` | Target architecture + acceptance criteria before building |
| `catalog-lookup` | Factual questions about frameworks, memory substrates, lab patterns, or adoption data |

## Out of scope

The Next.js workbench app at the **repo root** (`app/`, `lib/`, `scripts/`, etc.) is not part of the installed plugin. It is a local-only development tool for building and testing the skill content. Plugin users interact only with `plugin/SKILL.md` and its `references/` directory.

## Governing Thought

Agentic AI architectures are converging from isolated assistants toward protocol-standardized multi-agent ecosystems — but production deployment requires solving **coordination reliability**, not just model capability.

Three pillars support this:

1. **Five architecture eras** (2015–2026), each adding a capability layer: RL game-players → Transformers → First LLM agents → Framework explosion → Production systems with A2A/MCP protocols
2. **Five architecture types** along Autonomy × Coordination axes segment every known approach (see Taxonomy below)
3. **Binding constraints** are trust, governance, and coordination — not model capability. 70%+ multi-agent failures are systemic (MAST). Only 11% of orgs run production agents (Deloitte 2025). Gartner: 40%+ agentic projects canceled by 2027.

## Architecture Taxonomy

Five types along two axes: autonomy (how much human direction) × coordination (how agents interact).

### Type I — Augmented Assistant
Single LLM + tools, human in loop. L1–L2 autonomy. Single-turn horizon. **88% adoption.**
Examples: ChatGPT with plugins, basic RAG systems.

### Type II — Workflow Automaton
Human-coded paths with LLM as module. L2–L3 autonomy. Minutes horizon. **38% adoption.**
Linear/DAG topology. Designer + monitor human role.

### Type III — Orchestrated Agent Team
LLM orchestrator delegates to specialized workers. L3–L4 autonomy. Hours–days horizon. **23% adoption.**
Hub-and-spoke topology, 2–12 agents. Early production. **Current frontier.**

### Type IV — Networked Fabric
Protocol-mediated agent swarm. L4 autonomy. Days–weeks horizon. **~5% adoption.**
Mesh/federation topology, 10–100+ agents. Pilot/experimental. Governance + oversight human role.

### Type V — Autonomous Ecosystem
Self-goal-setting, self-modifying. L4–L5 autonomy. Continuous horizon. **~1% adoption.**
Adaptive network, unbounded agents. Research only. Human as strategic auditor.

### Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Type I | Type II | Type III | Type IV | Type V |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| Core | LLM + tools | Coded paths | LLM orchestrator | Distributed consensus | Self-modifying |
| Topology | Single node | Linear/DAG | Hub-and-spoke | Mesh | Adaptive |
| Agent Count | 1 | 1 (multi-step) | 2–12 | 10–100+ | Unbounded |
| Task Horizon | Single turn | Minutes | Hours–days | Days–weeks | Continuous |
| Human Role | Operator | Designer | Goal setter | Governance | Auditor |
| Readiness | Production | Production | Early production | Pilot | Research |

## 5 Points of Consensus

1. **Minimal agent = LLM + tools in a loop** — Every major source converges: Lilian Weng (2023), Anthropic, Swyx's IMPACT framework.

2. **Start simple, add complexity only when validated** — Anthropic, Chip Huyen, Harrison Chase all emphasize independently.

3. **Evaluations are critical** — Andrew Ng: evals are "the single biggest predictor of whether someone executes well."

4. **Compound errors are the fundamental math challenge** — Chip Huyen: 95% accuracy per step → only 0.6% accuracy over 100 steps.

5. **Tool design matters as much as prompt design** — Anthropic: tool descriptions deserve the same engineering attention as system prompts.

## 4 Active Debates

### 1. Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent
- **Pro multi-agent:** Anthropic June 2025: 90.2% improvement on research tasks. Parallelizable breadth tasks excel.
- **Pro single-agent:** Cognition: "Don't Build Multi-Agents." Reasoning models handle planning natively.
- **Resolution:** Use-case dependent. Multi-agent for breadth; single for depth. Cost: agents 4× tokens; multi-agent 15×.

### 2. Frameworks vs. Raw APIs
- **Pro frameworks:** Harrison Chase: capture collective wisdom, useful infrastructure.
- **Pro raw APIs:** Anthropic: "extra layers of abstraction obscure prompts and responses."
- **Resolution:** Own your cognitive architecture (differentiator). Outsource agentic infrastructure (task queues, persistence).

### 3. The "Bitter Lesson" for Agents
- **Pro scaffolding:** Harness changes yield 13.7pt gains. Frameworks provide collective wisdom.
- **Pro minimalism:** Manus refactored 5× in 6 months. Vercel removed 80% of tools → fewer steps, better results.
- **Resolution:** Heavy scaffolding may have diminishing returns. Lance Martin: "Over time you're having to strip away structure."

### 4. Augmentation vs. Automation
- **Augmentation camp:** Karpathy: "Iron Man suit, not Iron Man." Tesla Autopilot: 12 years without full autonomy.
- **Automation camp:** Claude Code and Devin demonstrate genuine autonomous capability in bounded domains.
- **Resolution:** Karpathy's "autonomy slider" — Cursor's Tab → cmd+K → Cmd+L → Agent mode. Let users control autonomy level.

These numbers are the empirical anchor for the methodology's "start single, justify multi" default. Cite them when a user pushes for multi-agent without cost/failure-mode justification.

## Future Trajectory

### Near (2026–2027) — Protocol Standardization
A2A and MCP become de facto standards. Vertical agents dominate (legal, finance, healthcare, code). Enterprise trust frameworks mature. Type III reaches 40%+ adoption.

### Mid (2027–2029) — Agent Economies
Type IV Networked Fabrics reach production. Agent-to-agent marketplaces emerge. Multi-agent governance becomes regulatory requirement. Human role shifts to strategic auditor.

### Far (2029+) — AGI Through Agents
Type V Autonomous Ecosystems enter narrow production. Self-improving systems raise safety considerations. International governance for autonomous AI networks. AGI may emerge through multi-agent collaboration, not single models.

## Coordination Patterns

Seven recurring patterns across all architectures:

| Pattern | Description | Complexity | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Prompt Chaining | Sequential LLM calls, each output feeds next | Low | Linear tasks with clear stages |
| Routing/Triage | Classify input → dispatch to specialist | Low | Multi-domain, heterogeneous queries |
| Parallelization | Multiple LLMs on same input simultaneously | Medium | Tasks decomposable into independent parts |
| Orchestrator-Workers | Lead agent delegates, synthesizes results | Medium | Research, complex analysis |
| Evaluator-Optimizer | Generate + critique + refine loop | Medium | Quality-critical outputs |
| Hierarchical | Multi-level delegation tree | High | Large-scale, enterprise workflows |
| Autonomous Loop | LLM decides when to stop | High | Open-ended, exploratory tasks |
